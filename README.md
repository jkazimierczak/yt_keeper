# YT Keeper
Keep any YouTube playlist intact.

Have you ever had a playlist where you had some videos deleted? This
tool aims to prevent that by downloading videos that are still 
available on YouTube. This of course won't recover any deleted or 
private videos, but if you download them before they get removed - you
are free to keep it, forever.

# Installing 
## With pipx
I recommend installing with pipx ([how to install pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/))
to avoid possible conflicts with other software on your machine:
```
pipx install git+https://github.com/jakubkazimierczak/yt_keeper
```
